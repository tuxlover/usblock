This script is intended as a startup init script.

It will lock up usbdevices at bootup by passing the
value "0" to /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb?/authorized_default.

After locking up usbdevice mapping it may be reopened by 
writing certain udev rules to whitelist allowed devices
afterwards as i describe in my weblog and also described 
in this $(article).
